Sperm calculations
Overview: The primary stock needs to be diluted down into a working stock so that 1 mL of working stock added to the sample results in a desired sperm concentration. 
There are three sperm concentrations to work-out
	The primary stock, calculated with the haemocytometer
	The working stock, determined by what is needed in the desired sperm concentration and made by diluting the primary stock
	The desired stock, determined by what is needed in the experiment and made by diluting 1mL or sperm with sample and 1 ml of eggs.
1) First work out what Working stock is required
Sample volume (inc. sperm volume (1ml) and 1 mL eggs)  Desired stock. For example:
 (x sperm)/(50 ml)=  (〖10〗^6  sperm)/(1 ml)         
  x sperm=5 x 107 sperm
This is the usual concentration to aim at for a 50 ml sample container. Obviously the working stock needs to have a lower sperm concentration than the primary stock, so if your primary stock is < 5 x 10^7, you will need to use a magnitude lower desired stock (10^5).
2) Work out how many mL of Primary stock need to be added to a XX ml container to create the Working stock.  Fill the rest with FSW to XX mL mark. For a 400 mL container. 
(x ml)/(400 ml)×Primary stock= Working stock

E.g.  
(x ml)/(400 ml)   ×      3×〖10〗^8 sperm ml= 5×〖10〗^7  sperm ml 

= 66 ml of the primary stock needs to be added to the 400 ml container.
Tips
	Your desired treatment should be adjust higher, so that the dilution of adding 2 mL of FSW (1 mL sperm +  mL eggs) results in desired treatment level. 
If you want to use magnitude lower sperm concentrations, make a dilution series transferring 10 ml of the working stock into 90 ml FSW.
